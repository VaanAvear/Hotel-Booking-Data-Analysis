# Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis

The data science project aims to perform data cleaning and data pre-processing on raw data. This will involve analyzing the data to identify missing or incorrect values, inconsistencies, and outliers. The project will require using techniques such as imputation, normalization, and scaling to transform the data into a format suitable for analysis.

The next task is to identify where the guests come from and perform spatial analysis. This will involve analyzing the data on the guests' locations to identify patterns and trends. The project may require using techniques such as geocoding and spatial clustering to identify hotspots and areas with high guest density.

The project also aims to determine how much guests pay for a room per night. This will involve analyzing the data on room prices to identify the average price per night and any trends or patterns.

The project also aims to determine how the price per night varies over the year. This will involve analyzing the data on room prices and booking dates to identify any seasonal patterns or trends.

In addition, the project aims to determine the distribution of nights spent at hotels by market segment and hotel type. This will involve analyzing the data on market segments and hotel types to identify any trends or patterns in guest behavior.

The project also aims to identify guest preferences. This will involve analyzing the data on guest reviews and ratings to identify what guests value the most in their hotel experience.

To analyze special requests made by customers, the project will require analyzing the data on special requests to identify patterns and trends in guest preferences.

To plot a pivot table of the relationship between special requests and the cancellation of booking status, the project will require creating a table that summarizes the data on special requests and booking cancellations.

The project also aims to identify the busiest months or the months with the highest number of guests. This will involve analyzing the data on guest arrivals to identify any seasonal patterns or trends.

To determine how long guests stay at both hotels, the project will require analyzing the data on guest check-in and check-out dates to calculate the length of stay.

The project also aims to identify bookings by market segment. This will involve analyzing the data on market segments to identify which segments make the most bookings.

To determine the price per night (ADR) and person based on bookings and room, the project will require analyzing the data on room prices and booking details to calculate the ADR and person-based rates.

Finally, the project aims to identify which months have the highest number of cancellations. This will involve analyzing the data on booking cancellations to identify any seasonal patterns or trends.
